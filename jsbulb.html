    <h3 style="color: rgb(23, 9, 216);"><p><i> <br>!---> An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric 
        light with a filament that is heated until it glows. <br>!---> The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb 
        that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. <br>!--->
        Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. <br>!--->
        A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections. <br>!--->
        Incandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, 
        from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. <br>!---> They require no external regulating equipment, have low 
        manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. <br>!--->
        As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting, 
        for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights. </h1></i></p></h3>
